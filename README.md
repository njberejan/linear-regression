# Linear Regression

This is the repository for the Linear Regression assignment from the Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with linear regression analysis, plotting, and using sklearn, as well as some simple machine learning.
We have been provided three data sets to work with, and were asked to find the linear regression equations, then to make predictions about trends in the data using machine learning objects. Please find my findings in the Jupyter Notebook file located on this repository.
